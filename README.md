# Cartloop Chat App 

This is a chat application, developed using React, Node, and Sockets.io. Users can chat with each other in real time by joining the same chat room. Users can also send text as well as emojis. 

Multiple users can join the same chat room. Users in the same chat room are notified when new person joins the chat and can see the current online users. When someone leaves the chat, other members in the chat room are notified.
